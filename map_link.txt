Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province,China, and is the most populous city in Central China.
It lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain at the intersection of the middle reaches of the Yangtze and Han rivers.
Arising out of the conglomeration of three cities, Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, Wuhan is known as "九省通衢"
(the Nine Provinces' (China's) Leading Thoroughfare)";
it is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to other major cities.
Because of its key role in domestic transportation, Wuhan was sometimes referred to as "the Chicago of China" by foreign sources.

To be honest, I choose it, just because it's of the right size.
